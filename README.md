# Word-Cloud
Creates a word cloud out of the text provided by the user

The main file runs on a jupyter notebook where you can insert a text file with text in it and the program will generate a word cloud based on the main and important words.

For instance, words like and, of, or etc will not be displayed as I will be filtering them out.
